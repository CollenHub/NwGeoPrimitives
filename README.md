# NwGeoPrimitives

NavisWorks .NET API plugin to traverse all nodes and extract geometrical primitives.

Initial code based
on [Navisworks-Geometry-Primitives](https://github.com/xiaodongliang/Navisworks-Geometry-Primitives)
by [Xiaodong Liang](https://github.com/xiaodongliang) that
in turn seems to be based on the NavisWorks COM API sample ActiveXDumpStructureExample,
cf. *COM/examples/ActiveX/ActiveXDumpStructureExample/Form1.cs*.
